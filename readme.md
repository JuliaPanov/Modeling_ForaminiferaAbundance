**Model List:**

  _Index_RF_Regression.sav_ - Random forest (RF) regression examining the relationship between evenness index Jâ€™ and the encoded habitat factors such as water depth, season, sampling site, and host macroalage morphotypes.

  _Site_RF_model.sav_ -Random forest model examining the relationship between sampling sites (Carmel Head and Akhziv) and the changes in the relative abundance of the dominant foraminifera species.

  _Depth_RF.sav_ - Random forest model examining the relationship between sampling site water depth category (VS-very shallow (5m); SH- shallow (7-10m); and I-intermediate (18m)) and the changes in the relative abundance of the dominant foraminifera species.

  _Algae_RF.sav_ - Random forest model examining the relationship between macroalgae type (red or brown) and the changes in the relative abundance of the dominant foraminifera species.
